            What is a Developer Portfolio Website?
A developer portfolio website provides relevant information to potential employers about your skills, experience, and projects you've worked on.

You can consider your portfolio website to be your online résumé.

Why you should have a Portfolio Website
1. A Portfolio Website Increases Your Online Presence
As a developer, you need an online presence. You can cultivate this online presence on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. But those are not entirely your own, as the moderators of those platforms have almost full control over your account.

With your own portfolio website, it's live on your own domain online. And people can easily find you when they search for your name on a search engine like Google, provided you put the right things in place when it comes to SEO.

2. A portfolio website is your online résumé
Your portfolio website is like your online résumé. Potential clients and hiring managers can easily find you online and check out your previous projects and skills.

This also means that when anyone wants to give you an opportunity to work for them, and they ask for your previous projects, you just give them one link to your website (your portfolio). It not only has your projects but your skillset and information about your past experience as well.

3. A Portfolio Website Shows Evidence of Expertise in your Field
Having (let alone building you own) portfolio website as a developer sends out a clear message that you're putting your skills into practice and that you know what you are doing.

A portfolio can also help build trust with clients because they have direct evidence of the quality of your work.

Portfolio Project – How to Build Your Own Online Developer Portfolio
You can make a cool portfolio website for yourself with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And that’s what we are going to do here.

I already did this some months ago and made it available to everyone as a free product on Gumroad, so I decided to create a tutorial on how I got it done.

This is the live demo of what we will be building.

To follow along with me, you can grab the starter files from Github.

The Project Folder Structure
To avoid confusion, I will be arranging the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, icons, and images of the project in their respective folders.

        The HTML file goes in the root folder, and the image, icon, CSS, and JavaScript files will be in their separate subfolders in an asset folder. This is a common practice.</p>
